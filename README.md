## Configuring Posture Compliance

Posture assessment verifies client device compliance with corporate security policies before granting access.

* **HostScan**: Checks endpoint compliance status.
* **ISE Posture Module**: Works with Cisco ISE to enforce policies.
* **Advanced Endpoint Assessment**: Evaluates antivirus and firewall status.

```json
{
    "compliance": {
        "antivirus": "enabled",
        "firewall": "active"
    }
}
```

## Using Network Visibility Module (NVM)

NVM delivers detailed insights into network behavior for improved threat detection.

* Collects information on app usage, traffic patterns, and device interactions.
* Supports granular traffic filtering for analysis.
* Integrates with SIEM systems for enhanced security monitoring.

> **Note:** Ensure all required kernel driver modules are installed and configured correctly to enable NVM functionality.
